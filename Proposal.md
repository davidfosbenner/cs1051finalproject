## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Sports Gambling Bambit Grapher

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that outputs the average amount of made from betting on a certain team in a certain category, i.e.  The averge amount of profit made by betting the over amount of points in an Eagles game. I will also take some of these outputs and put them into google analyics to maske visual graphics.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For this program the softeware I am going to need to use is Python and Google Analytics. I think it is going to be a challenge due to the fact that I am going to neeed to gain new knowledge, but in the end, it will work out. Features that it is going to have is user input, heavy file reading, and a strong understanding behind the data in order to get a proper output. It will be executed by using a function that reads the file storing the data abd returns the data for the given team in a certain category. In order to then turn these programs intp data vizualzations in Google Analytics, I will need to run the program and create a new file that stores all the results. Finally, I will need to call upon the written file and make the vizualizations.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project I think will be creating a program that outputs the average profit on betting on a certain team.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome I think will be a program that writes the results into a file, with vizualizations made of the created file.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome for my project is that it can take incomes from many leagues, and store them in seperate files, which then can be used to create numerous visualizations

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

This project that I have chosen is something that is definetley going to be a new challenge for me, a full on Data Analytics project. New skills I wqill need to acquire is the use of Google Analytics in roder to make the visualizations for my project, while this may be hard,  I do think that it is well within my abilities to accomplish this. I may also need to need to learn how to work with the statistics library in Python, which I also think is within my abilities. A bulk of the research I will need to do is finding the data needed to accomplish my goal. I am not sure how readily avaiable this information is, and if the informnation I am finding is always reliable. I will need to research which websites will has the most accurate data and then work my way from there.
