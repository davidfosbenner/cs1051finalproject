# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
The Great Twitter Sports Betting Line Maker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
This program will take two teams, a home and an away given from the user, and it will then rply to the tweet from the user with a standard point spread betting line. The line is calculated using previous scores from this season and power rankings from the given week.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For this program the softeware I am going to need to use is Python and Twitter Developer. This program in Idle will use file reading, many f statements, and a self made algorithim to, as close as I can, predict the difference in points in a sports game. It is going to be executed using csores from past games eing read from a csv file and power rankings that will also be read from a csv file. The twitter bot will be created through Twitters User Devlopment Services, and the Tweepy Library in Python. When called upon, the twitter bot wqill run the program, given the home team and the away team, and will then reply to the tweet that clled upon it with the score.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project I think will be creating a program that outputs the spread given a home and away team in the NFL.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome I think will be a program that writes the predicted point spread into a file, and also replies to the tweets to 2 different leagues such as the NBA and the NFL.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome for my project is that it can predict point spreads from many different leagues, and store them in seperate files, and reply to the users tweet with a given spread.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps I will need to take in order to accomplish the goals I made for this project include finding the data, figuring out the algorithim for makingh point spreads, and also becoming familiar with the tweepy library. New skills I will need to acquire are becoming familiar with the tweepy library. I have never worked with this library before, so I will need to work from the ground up in order to find a way to successfully complete this project. I also need to do plenty of research to find how these point spreads are calculated so I am able to give accurate predictins, and I am not just throwing number at a wall, I need them to be reliable. Another piece of research I will need to complete os the data that is used to make the algorithim, and making sure that data is accuarate and can be used to make my prediction.
