What I learned
  That coding is not easy in a nutshell. I had the basic outline of my code done very quickly, and I started to think to myself if I had perhaps chosen a project     that was too easy. Then, when I started to build the twitter bot, I hit a wall. This code taight me that edven though you have an idea of what you are doing, and   you know what you are trying to accomplish, the debugging, and trial and errror part is what is going to take most of your time.
What I enjoyed
  My favorite part about this code was building the algorithim that is used to calculate the spreads. While it is not very complicated and may not be the most         accurate, I had a lot of fun creating it.
Difficulties Overcame
    The biggest difficulty I had to overcome with this project was getting what I needed out of the tweet. The raw tweet that is extraected from the website has      many lines of HTML code in it, and sifiting through all of it to get the team names was diffiult. I overcame this by couting the index of the actual tweet inside the code, and then making a seperate list that is iterated through to find the teams. Another difficulty I had was dowloading tweepy onto my computer. However, that problem was solved rather quickly once Professor Rosen pointed out to me that I had a file named tweepy on my computer.
