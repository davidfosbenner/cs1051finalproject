#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far for my project I have created the algorrithim that is used to calculate the spreads for NFL games, and have it take user input to give the output of the line. I have also connected to twitters development program, which allows me to use the twitter bot on their platform

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not built the part of the program that connects to twitters, and senses when it is called. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Downloading tweepy has been a large issue for me, as whenever I download it it says it is downloaded, but when I call it it does not recoginize the library
